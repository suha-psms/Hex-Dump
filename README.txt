Suha Patel
Eric Alvarado

We both spent time working on the project, but Suha worked more on main and hexfuncs.c while eric supported and worked on unit tests. We both worked on assembly equally. 
There were some functions that Suha worked on more and some that Eric wrote. In general, we worked an equal amount.

Eric and Suha worked on writing unit tests together. Eric focused more on completing main, and Suha focused more on completing
the functions, but all in all we did equal amount of work.
